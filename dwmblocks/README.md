This repository contains my dwmblocks configuration which I use daily.

# üìñ Installation
------------

You will need gcc, make and required libraries which vary distro by distro.

#### Void Linux

```bash
xbps-install -S gcc make
```

For libraries it could be libX11, libX11-devel, libXft, libXft-devel etc. If the required library is missing then it will show an error and you just need to take the name and find the right package.

#### Then clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/zagyarakushi/mydwmblocks
```


# üìù Usage
-----

Now go to the directory and compile and install.

#### Compile

```bash
make
```

Then intall dwmblocks

#### Install

```bash
make install
```

Or just do "make install" which should compile and install at the same time.

#### Updating

If you make a change and want to update the binary then you need to recompile and install again. Except this time, you need to remove some files.

#### Remove compiled binary and some files

```bash
make clean
```

#### Delete old configuration files

```bash
rm config.h
```

Also make sure to delete any other unneeded files as well. Then compile and install.
